# NYT_Subscription
Recreated the NYT subscription service through Python web scraping and SMTP

I created multiple functions that serve as ways to send the current New York Times Information into an email text format. I utilized various different built in python modules to assist in the development of this webscraper such as BeautfifulSoup, SMTP, validate_email, and more. 

I initially wanted to make this into a web app but due to the potential legal and ethical issues revolving around web scraping I have chosen not continue developing this project. However, I did learn a lot about file parsing and how we can start up server and email access.


If you do plan to use this service bot, you will need to modify some permissions in your emai.
